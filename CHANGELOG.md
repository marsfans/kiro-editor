# [0.3.5](https://github.com/rhysd/kiro-editor/releases/tag/0.3.5) - 19 Oct 2019

- **Improve:** Text search was much improved!
  - Search word which reveals twice or more in a line are all correctly matched. Previous
    implementation (and kilo) only matches to first searched word in one line
  - Current match is now at middle of screen, not at top
  - Other matches than current are also highlighted like famous text editors
  - Ctrl-J and Ctrl-W are supported in text search prompt
  - Cursor moves to prompt line so that it makes easier to show now inputting characters for text
    search
- **Fix:** Welcome message is not shown on empty buffer. Now welcome screen is rendered only at start
  up if the buffer is unnamed
- **Improve:** Colorscheme is optimized
  - Color of `~` after end of buffer is improved
  - Colors of current match and other matches while text search was updated. They are now easier to
    distinguish
- **Improve:** Reduce heap allocation on parsing UTF-8 char in input byte sequence
- **Fix:** Raise an error properly on invalid multi-byte sequence and too small window resizing
- **Fix:** Cursor position was not correct on inserting a tab character
- **Fix:** Editor crashes when trying to search text at the end of buffer
- **Improve:** Reduce reallocation on updating rendered text in row
- **Improve:** Add `first_paint()` method to `kiro_editor::Editor` which returns an iterator to run the
  editor
- **Improve:** [Benchmarks](https://github.com/rhysd/kiro-editor/tree/master/benches) were introduced to
  avoid performance regression
- **Improve:** [Use GitHub Actions](https://github.com/rhysd/kiro-editor/actions?workflow=CI) for CI

- **Fix:** `usize` keyword highlighting was wrong in Rust source code
- **Fix:** Background color does not end at end of line
- **Improve:** Use better invert yellow color for matched region on text search
- **Improve:** For special variables such as `this`, `self`, use different color from boolean constants like `true`, `false`
- **Improve:** Show matched line from head of the line as much as possible on moving to next/previous match
- **Improve:** Use [jemalloc](http://jemalloc.net/) for global memory allocator of `kiro` executable
